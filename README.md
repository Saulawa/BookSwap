# Contributions
All the designs I implement are intended to be for learning more about techniques to create beautiful Xamarin.Forms interfaces. 

I welcome pull requests and suggestions to improve the solution. Please just raise an issue or submit a pull request.

Feel free to take this code and do what you will, but please make sure you acknowledge myself and also the original designer.
